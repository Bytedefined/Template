### Template
This is a basic template for all future Fll repositories.

<br>

# How to use your repository

## Open a terminal and run

<br>

> git init

> git clone \<link to the repository>

<br>

And cd into your new repository

<br>

# How to push your changes to the repository

<br>

First you need to stage your changes using this command

<br>

> git add .

<br>

Now you need to make a commit explaining the changes you made
in a few words using

<br>

> git commit -m "Made a change"

<br>

The -m allows you to add a description to the commit

<br>

now just use the git push command

<br>

> git push
