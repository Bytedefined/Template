# How to use your repository

Firstly you must have git installed as well as the git lens extension

<br>

### **Windows Link**

<br>

### **Linux Install**

If you’re on Fedora (or any closely-related RPM-based distribution, such as RHEL or CentOS), you can use dnf:

<br>

> $ sudo dnf install git-all

<br>

If you’re on a Debian-based distribution, such as Ubuntu, try apt:

<br>

> $ sudo apt install git-all

<br>

### **Mac Os Install**

> https://git-scm.com/download/mac

<br>

## **Gitlens Extension**

You can install it using the vscode marketplace 

<br>

# When you have git open a terminal in the folder you want it in and run

<br>

> git init

> git clone \<link to the repository>

<br>

And cd into your repository folder

<br>

# How to push your changes to the repository

<br>

First you need to stage your changes using this command

<br>

> git add .

<br>

Now you need to make a commit explaining the changes you made
in a few words using

<br>

> git commit -m "Made a change"

<br>

The -m allows you to add a description to the commit

<br>

now just use the git push command

<br>

> git push
